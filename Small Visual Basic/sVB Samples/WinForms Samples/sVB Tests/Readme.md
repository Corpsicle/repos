This unit test project is written with Small Visual Basic.
It is still under progress to cover all sVB library types, and may also contain tests for some sVB syntax.
This project will be updated continously with bug fixes that the tests discover.
Some parts of the tests are also used as examples in the sVB liberary reference book, which will be realeased after completed.
